# YOLOv5 HAND SIGN Project Documentation


## Introduction

Welcome to the YOLOv5 HAND SIGN project documentation! This project focuses on detecting and recognizing six different hand gestures using the YOLOv5 deep learning model. The hand gestures include "hello," "perfect," "I love you," "follow me," "engamir," and "no."

## Project Overview

The YOLOv5 HAND SIGN project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection architecture, specifically YOLOv5, to detect and classify hand gestures in images or videos. YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its accuracy and speed.

## Hand Gestures

The following six hand gestures are recognized by the YOLOv5 HAND SIGN project:

1. **Hello**: A waving hand gesture.
2. **Perfect**: A hand gesture signifying perfection with the thumb and forefinger forming a circle.
3. **I Love You**: A hand gesture representing "I love you" in sign language, with the pinky, index finger, and thumb extended.
4. **Follow Me**: A hand gesture indicating someone to follow with the palm facing forward.
5. **Engamir**: A specific hand gesture.
6. **No**: A hand gesture for indicating negation or disagreement with a shaking motion.
